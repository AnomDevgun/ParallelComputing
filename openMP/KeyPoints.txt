Race condition: is when unintended access is done by threads, to solve this we use synchronization techniques.
Synchronization: should be used as little as possible as it makes the effectivness of multi threaded programming less.
openMP: allows for multithreaded programming on shared memory architechture (SMP- symmetric multiprocessing)
The main program i.e main thread that calls all other threads is itself a thread, thread 0 and runs alongside the other threads in a "team of threads" so as to speak.
openMP interacts with the compiler via pthreads library at its core, its basically pthreads abstracted to save you the effort of the low level interaction.
