Race condition: is when unintended access is done by threads, to solve this we use synchronization techniques.
Synchronization: should be used as little as possible as it makes the effectivness of multi threaded programming less.
openMP: allows for multithreaded programming on shared memory architechture (SMP- symmetric multiprocessing)
